# 📚 Resources for Econ-IS Students

This page contains a collection of useful resources that I found for Econ-IS Students.

# GenAI-related

- Tom Cunningham (Economics/AI Research, between OpenAI & METR)

    - **[Tom Cunningham's AI Notes](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2025-09-19-transformative-AI-notes.html)**: A comprehensive collection of notes about economics & AI, based on workshops including the Windfall Trust & NBER. The differences between opinions from industry professionals and economic scholars are really impressive.

# Econ-IS PhD Resources

- Jonathan Dingel (Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at Columbia University)

    - **[http://www.jdingel.com/teaching/advice.html](http://www.jdingel.com/teaching/advice.html)**: Valuable collection of guidance and recommended resources for economics PhD students.
    - **[https://tradediversion.net/category/jmps/](https://tradediversion.net/category/jmps/)**: A collection of Job Market Papers focused on trade and spatial economics.

- Daron Acemoglu (Professor in the Department of Economics at MIT)

    - **[https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Reading%20List](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Reading%20List.pdf)**: MIT Econ-PhD reading list of labor economics. It covers 5 streams (Labor Market Externalities, Social Mobility, Peer Effects and Human Capital, Incentives, Agency and Efficiency Wage, Investment in Skills, Search and Unemployment). This reading list is not just a collection of papers, but organized by micro observations, macro implications, and finally identification (within each stream). The purpose of reading is to master the core causal mechanism logic in labor economics.
