> I've always believed that the strength of being a social science researcher lies in two things:
> - 1) being able to abandon our initial "intuitions", delve deep into logical analysis, and trace where those gut feelings actually come from;
> - 2) serving the broader population rather than just elites, paying special attention to the most vulnerable groups, with a commitment to equity and striving to create meaningful change.
> 
> Do this kind of research, so that I won't regret.

🦸‍♂️I am a year-3 PhD candidate in the [Department of Information Systems](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/is/research/introduction.html) in the College of Business at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Ben LIU](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/qianqliu/) and [Prof. Xin LI](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mm/people/academic-staff/prof-xin-li/). I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [South China University of Technology](http://cnsba.scut.edu.cn/xyjj/list.htm) as one of the TOP 10 outstanding undergraduate students in June 2023.

My research interests span two primary streams: (1) investigating IT professionals, corporations, and consumers within open source collaborative ecosystems, and (2) advancing social justice, particularly in healthcare operations management and services for vulnerable populations.

Dylan employs methodologies including econometrics and machine learning techniques with a strong emphasis on credible causal inference. For theoretical development, he applies analytical modeling and qualitative research methods.

Beyond academics, Dylan enjoys 🏸Badminton, 🥾Hiking & Mountaineering, 🍳Cooking, 🎶Music, 🍸Cocktail mixing, and ✍️Writing.
